üíº HR Analytics Dashboard:

A data-driven web application to monitor and analyze employee performance, predict attrition risk, and provide HR insights using a role-based login system. Built using Streamlit, MySQL, and Python, this project enables HRs, Admins, and Employees to interact with data in real-time.

üìå Overview:

This HR Analytics system helps organizations keep track of employee performance and retention using interactive dashboards and predictive analytics. The system provides:
- Department-wise and demographic insights
- Attrition prediction for active employees
- Role-based access (HR, Admin, Employee)
- Real-time data updates through MySQL backend

üéØ Objective:

To build a comprehensive HR Analytics Dashboard that:
- Tracks key HR metrics such as attrition, performance rating, and promotions
- Allows employees to enter and update their information
- Enables admins to edit employee work-related details
- Predicts potential employee attrition using ML models
- Provides HRs with data insights for better decision-making

üí° Motivation:

Organizations today face major challenges in retaining top talent and identifying performance gaps. This project was inspired by the need to:
- Leverage data analytics for better HR management
- Digitize employee records and dashboards
- Create a system where employee information is accessible and manageable through a unified platform
- Enable predictive insights for proactive HR strategies

üß∞ Technologies Used:

- Frontend: Streamlit
- Backend: Python (Pandas, Plotly, Seaborn, Matplotlib, bcrypt, streamlit_kpi)
- Database: MySQL (with pymysql connector)
- Authentication: Role-based login system (HR, Admin, Employee)

üóÉÔ∏è Database Setup (MySQL):

The project uses a MySQL database named hr_analytics which contains three tables:
- user ‚Äì Stores login credentials and user roles.
- employee_details ‚Äì Stores personal employee information.
- employee_dashboard ‚Äì Stores work-related details for analytics and predictions.

üîß Steps to Setup MySQL:

Install MySQL Server if not already installed.
- Windows: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/

Login to MySQL CLI or GUI (like MySQL Workbench).

Create the database:
CREATE DATABASE hr_analytics;

Inside hr_analytics, create the following three tables:
- user
- employee_details
- employee_dashboard

üóÇÔ∏è Database Schema
1. user Table: Stores user login information and roles.
CREATE TABLE user (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    role ENUM('HR', 'admin', 'employee') NOT NULL
);

2. employee_details Table: Stores basic personal information of employees.
CREATE TABLE employee_details (
    EmployeeID INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    EmployeeName VARCHAR(100),
    ContactNumber VARCHAR(20),
    Email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,
    Address TEXT,
    Gender ENUM('Male', 'Female', 'Other'),
    Age INT,
    MaritalStatus ENUM('Single', 'Married', 'Divorced', 'Widowed'),
    JoiningDate DATE,
    LastWorkingDay DATE
);

3. employee_dashboard Table: Stores employee work-related details used for analytics and attrition prediction.
CREATE TABLE employee_dashboard (
    EmployeeID INT,
    BusinessTravel VARCHAR(50),
    DailyRate INT,
    Department VARCHAR(50),
    DistanceFromHome INT,
    Education INT,
    EducationField VARCHAR(50),
    HourlyRate INT,
    JobInvolvement INT,
    JobLevel INT,
    JobRole VARCHAR(50),
    JobSatsfaction INT,
    MonthlyIncome INT,
    MonthlyRate INT,
    NumCompaniesWorked INT,
    OverTime ENUM('Yes', 'No'),
    PercentSalaryHike INT,
    PerformanceRating INT,
    TotalWorkingYears INT,
    YearsAtCompany INT,
    YearsInCurrentRole INT,
    YearsSinceLastPromotion INT,
    YearsWithCurrentManager INT,
    PRIMARY KEY (EmployeeID),
    FOREIGN KEY (EmployeeID) REFERENCES employee_details(EmployeeID) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
